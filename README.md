# WooCommerce Custom My Account Area with Affiliate Integration

This project extends WooCommerce by creating a custom My Account area using React.js, tailored to integrate seamlessly with the Affiliate for WooCommerce plugin. It addresses the limitation of the Affiliate for WooCommerce plugin not adding its page to a custom My Account area by providing a custom endpoint for affiliate functionality within our React-based My Account area.

## Features

- **Custom My Account Area**: Reimagines the WooCommerce My Account area using React.js for a more dynamic user experience.
- **Affiliate Program Integration**: Custom endpoint and integration for the Affiliate for WooCommerce plugin within the custom My Account area.
- **Plugin Extensibility**: Designed as a plugin to easily integrate with existing WooCommerce setups.
